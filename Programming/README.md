# Programming 💻

### Code is Poetry, and Here's My Anthology 📚

Welcome to the **Programming** folder, where every line of code is a line of verse—just with fewer rhymes and more semicolons.

### What's Inside? 🗂️
- **Scripts**: Short, sweet, and to the point. These scripts do one thing well, and they do it fast.
- **Algorithms**: My take on making computers think faster, better, and sometimes just differently.
- **Code Snippets**: Little nuggets of code wisdom, saved for the next time I find myself in a tight spot.

### Why Should You Care? 🤔
Because anyone can write code, but not everyone can do it with this much style. Get in, get inspired, and maybe even learn something new. 💡
