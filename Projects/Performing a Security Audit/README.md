# Security Audit for Botium Toys 🧸💻

Welcome to my **Security Audit** project, completed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Certification**. This was a hands-on exercise where I conducted an internal security audit for a **fictional company** (yes, Botium Toys isn’t real, but the lessons are!).

## 🎯 Project Overview:  
Botium Toys, a growing U.S.-based toy company with a booming online presence, wanted a serious security overhaul. The IT manager was worried about business continuity, compliance, and potential security risks (who wouldn’t be?). My mission: assess the company’s security posture, spot vulnerabilities, and make them audit-ready.

### Part 1: Setting the Stage  
- **Scope**: The audit covered everything from physical assets to online operations and payment processing. Even regulations like GDPR and U.S. compliance got their spotlight.

  - Identify security weaknesses  
  - Assess compliance with U.S. and EU payment regulations

### Risk Assessment 🚨  
A deep dive into their infrastructure to highlight risks that could disrupt critical assets, business operations, and compliance with international standards. This step set the priorities for the rest of the audit.

### Part 2: Controls & Compliance 💡  
**Controls Assessment**:  
- Access control, network security, data protection? ✅  
- Incident response, employee awareness, and training? You bet. 💻

## 🚀 Project Impact:
This project was a serious level-up for me as a cybersecurity pro-in-the-making. From diving deep into security audits to building risk assessments and compliance checklists, it was like taking a crash course in real-world cyber defense. Aligning with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** gave me hands-on experience in securing digital assets and keeping business operations smooth, even when facing global compliance hurdles.

What really stood out? Turning all that tech jargon into something the business side could actually use. Translating security speak into business value? Nailed it. 💡

This project wasn’t just a box-checker—it was a massive boost to my skills and confidence, and it’s just the start of me taking on bigger cybersecurity challenges. Watch out, world. 😎
