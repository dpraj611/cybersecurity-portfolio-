### The Brain Behind the Code 🧠

Welcome to the **Education** folder—proof that I didn’t just Google everything (well, not everything).

### What's Inside? 🗂️
- **Coursework**: The academic grind that made me the cybersecurity enthusiast I am today. It's all here.
- **Certifications**: A collection of badges that say, "Yes, I actually know what I’m doing."
- **Extra Learning**: Because sometimes the classroom just isn’t enough. Here’s where the real self-study happens.

### Why Should You Care? 🤔
You could call this my academic pedigree, or just a collection of PDFs and notes. Either way, it’s a testament to the fact that I’ve put in the work to back up my skills. 🏅
